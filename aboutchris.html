									<h3 class="major">Academic Background</h3>
									<p>In August 2019, I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and minor studies in Mathematics and General Business. My time at VCU included extra coursework focused on aspects of mechanical engineering, which laid the groundwork for my aspirations to work in the world of data.</p>

									<p>In April of 2024, I graduated from the Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program at Western Governor’s University (WGU).  My interest in the program culminated during my undergraduate studies as I wanted to build the skills needed to utilize the various tools and methods that derive insights.  The coursework took me through the stages of the data life cycle while working on projects that would be applicable to a professional environment.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Professional Career</h3>
									<p>During my time at VCU, I was a swim coach. Our team utilized a platform that included a database for the swimmers, which gave coaches the ability to run reports and add practice details. Having access to such a tool started piquing my interest in understanding how that information could be compiled. It also showed me how important that information was to taking action, which helped build a great team and lead swimmers to meet their potential.</p>

									<p>After graduation, I took the first steps in building a career centered around data. I found an opportunity to join a company called RetailData, which had a core around providing competitive pricing intelligence data. Since then, I have likened my experience to zooming out on a telescope. Various roles there have given me a view of what the individual data points look like and how billions of those points are used to create a larger picture.</p>

									<p>My first role was in the Central Validation department, where we reviewed individual and grouped data points for accuracy. We were given specific parameters and data points to compare to. This zoomed-in view showed me firsthand the importance of quality data and how validation can be used to ensure a final data set is comprised of accurate details.</p>

									<p>Shortly after, I was given the opportunity to join the Data Curation and Delivery team. My roles here was a great introduction to how the company processes worked, from collecting data to delivering it to clients. This provided a broader view of how a company focused on data handles each stage, as well as exposure to being an end user for analytical reports.</p>

									<p>My current role added more perspective on what clients who are receiving the data have.  Getting a direct account of how data is transferred between databases, what information different companies need, and how the data is being used has given me a larger view of how a data company can meet its goals through satisfied clients.  It also led to working with the analytics department to create and develop analytical reports for internal and external use.</p>

									<p>My goal is to utilize the knowledge and experience I have gained working in these roles to further my career in the world of data.  The classroom, practical, and technical experience I have gained only further my ambitions to have an opportunity to show how I can put all these skills together in a meaningful role.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Personal</h3>
									<p>I want to think I live up to my last name, as I have been an avid camper since I was a kid. I grew up in Cub and Boy Scouts, truly enjoying that aspect. I have continued this hobby with my wife and dog, as we enjoy finding new spots to relax and enjoy the outdoors!</p>

									<p>My interest in data doesn’t only revolve around a professional environment. I have always liked gathering information for insights, and as a result, I am working on building projects centered around personal interests such as sports, energy, and financial investments.</p>
